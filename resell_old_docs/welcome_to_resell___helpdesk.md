After a customer completes a purchase, a standard Shopify **Thank you page** appears - this is the moment when many entrepreneurs are likely missing out on additional revenue opportunities.

The Thank you page is a prime opportunity to offer your customer a related product, helping to **increase your average order value**. And with ReSell, you can turn this page into a revenue driver by showing relevant post-purchase offers!

Create funnels for specific products or categories, and let ReSell automatically display personalized upsells that increase your average order value and overall profits.
