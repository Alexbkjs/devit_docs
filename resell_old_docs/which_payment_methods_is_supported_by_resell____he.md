# Which payment methods is supported by ReSell?

# Supported Payment Methods

# ✔️ Post-Purchase offers

There are some restrictions from Shopify's side. The Post-purchase page is available on Shopify and works correctly with the following payment methods:

*   Shopify Payments
*   [PayPal Express](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/payments/paypal) (with Automatic Payments enabled, PayPal knows them as Reference Transactions)
*   [Shop Pay](https://www.shopify.com/blog/shop-pay-checkout)
*   PayPal Pro, PayPal PayFlow (when used with a credit card)
*   Braintree (without CVV verification enabled)
*   Stripe

There are also some limitations where post-purchase will not work. You can learn more about them from this article - [Why is my post-purchase upsell offer not displayed?](https://help.devit.software/en/article/why-is-my-post-purchase-upsell-offer-not-displayed-r7ztw/)

# ✔️ Checkout, Thank You page, Order Status page

Checkout, Thank you page, and Order Status pages do not depend on the payment method. There are no limitations for these stages.

Please also note that Shopify only supports vaulted card payment processors. For more information, please refer to this article: [Vaulted payment processors](https://help.devit.software/en/article/vaulted-payment-processors-1fsu0eu/).
