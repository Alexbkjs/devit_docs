## ✔️ What are vaulted payment processors?

Vaulted payment processors are payment gateways that securely store (or "vault") customer payment details for future transactions. This enables merchants to process payments without requiring customers to re-enter their payment information every time they make a purchase.

This functionality is crucial for enhancing the shopping experience by enabling features such as one-click upsells, recurring subscriptions, and a faster, frictionless checkout process. By securely retaining payment credentials, vaulted payment processors help businesses improve conversion rates and customer retention while ensuring compliance with industry security standards.
