## ✔️ Create your first funnel

Let's take a closer look at how this feature work.

When a customer completes a purchase in your store, you can use the **Thank You page** to displayt a **post-purchase upsell** - offering related products or a special deal to encourage an additional purchase.

### Step 1. Create a funnel

1. On the **Dashboard** or **Funnels** tab click on the **Create funnel** button.
2. Select the way you want to create the funnel: AI template or Manually.

* **AI template** - an offer created automatically. You can edit this funnel and publish it immediately.
* **Manually** - a manually created offer. (Instructions below)

### Step 2. Set the display conditions

1. Select the trigger that will launch the funnel:

* **Certain product** - triggers the funnel if a customer selects a selected product from your store.
* **Product from collection** - triggers the funnel when a customer buys any product from the chosen collection.
* **Any product** in the store - applies the funnel to all products in your store.

2. Click **Choose product** and select the product which will trigger this funnel.
3. Select appropriate condition to make funnel more personalized (optional).
4. Click **Next step**.

### Step 3. Checkout (Shopify Plus only)

This option is **available for Shopify Plus** plan. If you use Basic or another Shopify plan, this step will be hidden for you. On this step you can select products that will be offered customers during the checkout process **before** payment.

### Step 4. Post-purchase offer

Click **Add offer** and select the product (you can also select the Collection or Any option).

You will see three available offers. Use all of them or just one. If you use all three offers, the sequence of their display will be the following:

First, you show **Upsell Offer #1**.

* If the customer accepts it, **Upsell Offer #2** appears.
* If the customer declines, a **Downsell Offer** is shown instead.

This way, you can present up to **two additional products** to each customer.

> Note, that you can **edit offer** and add different widgets like Add-on Services and Free Shipping Progress Bar.

### Step 5. Thank you page upsell offer

The ReSell application also allows you to configure the Thank you page upsell offer - display sales offers, provide coupons, and special propositions and stimulate customers to make another purchase.

### Step 6. POS

If you have the POS app, this step will be available for you. It allows you to add additional products during the checkout process at the POS-terminal.

### Step 7. Order Status Page

On this step you can offer customers to buy additional products, collections or automatic offer to the Order status page after checkout.
