Yes, sure! Shopify allows its clients to use additional services that can improve their online stores.

To track customer data and behaviour on your online store you can add Facebook Pixel and Google Analytics.

> Make sure that you have [Facebook Pixel](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/952192354843755) and [Google Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153#account).

1.  Open your Shopify store and click on Shopify **Settings**.
2.  Click on **Checkout** > scroll to the **Post-purchase page** section. In the **Additional script** section add necessary scripts.
