# How does the post-purchase upsell offer affect my fulfillment?

## How does an offer affect fulfillment?

The upsell offer doesn’t create a new order. It edits the original order. The price of orders is summed up and customers do not have to pay twice.

According to the Shopify rules, the upsell offer will create a [fulfillment hold](https://shopify.dev/changelog/post-purchase-fulfillment-holds) for [an hour](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/fulfillment/fulfilling-orders/fulfill-your-own?shpxid=7509cf43-B4CB-4673-D187-ED402046F424#fulfillment-holds). It means that the order fulfillment status will be set to **On hold** when the customer is presented with the upsell offer. The status of the order will be kept for an hour so that the customer has the opportunity to return and complete or reject it.
