# What is a post-purchase offer?

## Post-purchase Offer

## ✔️ What is post-purchase offer

**Post-purchase offers** are additional sales pages or blocks displayed to customers right **after** they complete their **purchase**, **but before** they reach the **Thank You page**.

Example: If you sell phones, you can offer related accessories as post-purchase upsell or downsell offers. When a customer accepts an offer, the additional order is charged automatically.

The customer can buy a promoted product in one click. These offers are risk-free and can increase the average order value.

## ✔️ Limitations

Shopify provides limitations for post-purchase offers.

For example, Shopify doesn’t support third-party payment providers that require storing CVV data. This includes Braintree, Payflow Pro, PayPal Payments Pro, and Eway.

There are also some limitations for additional payment methods. Thus, the post-purchase page won’t appear if:

1.  The customer checks out using an installment or wallet service (such as Klarna, Affirm, AfterPay, Apple Pay, Amazon Pay, or Google Pay).
2.  The order is paid with a gift card or any non-credit card method.

You can view the full list of restrictions in the Shopify article - [Limitations](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/product-offers#limitations).
