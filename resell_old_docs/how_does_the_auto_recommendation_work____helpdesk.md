# How does the auto recommendation work?

# ✔️ What is an automatic offer?

**Automatic offer** - an option that allows merchants to automatically display product recommendations to customers immediately after a purchase. This offer is based on the items in the customer's cart and displays products related to items in cart.

Example: when a customer buys a bike, the app may automatically suggest a **bike helmet** as a post-purchase upsell - though this **depends on several factors**.

Shopify has its own built-in functionality for [determining recommendations](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/product-merchandising/recommendations), and ReSell relies on this functionality for Automatic offers.

# ✔️ How Shopify recommendations work

There are two types of recommendations:

*   **Related recommendations** - the platform offers a mix of products that are similar or complementary to a product the customer is interacting with. These recommendations are generated automatically by Shopify.
*   **Complementary recommendations** - Shopify offers products that complement a specific product the customer is interacting with. These recommendations need to be [manually set up](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/search-and-discovery/product-recommendations).

You can set up both types of recommendations for free in the [Shopify Search & Discovery](https://apps.shopify.com/search-and-discovery) app.

# ✔️ Recommendation logic

[Recommendation logic](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/product-merchandising/recommendations#recommendation-logic) is based on: purchase history, product description, and related collections.

*   **Purchase history** - Finds products that have historically been purchased together.
*   **Product description** - Finds products with similar descriptions.
*   **Related collections** - Finds products from collections that the current product is part of, excluding collections with handles all and frontpage.

> Important! We are not responsible for recommended products. Since the selection of recommended products is based on Shopify's internal algorithms and Shopify Search & Discovery app settings, we cannot control which products will be recommended to customers.
