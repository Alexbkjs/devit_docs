# If customers agree to buy a promoted product, do they need to re-enter their payment info?

## Re-enter Payment Information?

No, they don’t need to re-enter their payment information.

One-click upsell is available for **Post-purchase**. When a customer agrees to buy a promoted product, he just accepts the offer and it’s charged automatically.

On the **Thank you page** step customers can edit payment information or create a new order. As far as that's a separate order and it will be charged separately.
