# What is the offer sequence? How additional products will be shown to customers?

## The Offer Sequence

**1. Checkout** (available for Shopify Plus stores only)

After completing checkout, the customer sees the first post-purchase upsell offer.

**2. Post-Purchase Offers**

*   If the customer accepts the first offer, they are shown a second upsell offer (optional).
*   If they decline the first offer, a downsell offer (optional) can be displayed instead.

**3. Thank You Page**

Once the post-purchase offers are complete, the customer is redirected to the Thank You page, where you can display one additional offer.

**4. Order Status Page**

On the Order Status page, you can showcase extra products, collections, or automated offers to encourage repeat purchases.
