description: Learn how to create your first workflow in React Flow and start automating your Shopify store tasks.
---

This guide will walk you through creating your first workflow in React Flow. You'll learn the basics of triggers, conditions, and actions to automate common store tasks.

## Prerequisites

- React Flow app installed from the [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/react-flow)
- Access to your Shopify store admin panel

## Understanding Workflows

A **workflow** is an automated sequence of actions that runs when specific conditions are met. Every workflow consists of three components:

1. **Trigger**: The event that starts the workflow
2. **Condition** (optional): Rules that determine if actions should execute
3. **Action**: What happens when the workflow runs

## Create Your First Workflow

Let's create a workflow that tags VIP customers based on their spending.

### Step 1: Access React Flow Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open React Flow">
    From your Shopify admin, go to Apps → React Flow
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Dashboard">
    You'll see your workflow dashboard with three tabs:
    - **All**: All workflows
    - **On**: Active workflows
    - **Off**: Inactive workflows
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create New Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Create New">
    Click the **Create new** button in the top right corner
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Workflow Builder">
    You'll be taken to the visual workflow builder interface
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Select a Trigger

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Trigger Type">
    In the right panel, browse or search for triggers

    For this example, select **Order paid** trigger
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand the Trigger">
    This workflow will start every time a customer completes payment

    <Note>
    The trigger is the foundation of your workflow. Choose carefully based on when you want automation to occur.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Add a Condition

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Plus Icon">
    Click the **+** icon below the trigger
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Condition">
    Click the **Condition** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Condition Type">
    In the right panel, navigate to:

    **Order / Customer / Amount spent / Average order amount**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Condition Value">
    In the right field:
    - Select matcher: **greater than or equal to**
    - Enter value: **750**

    This checks if the customer's average order amount is $750 or more
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 5: Add an Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Plus on 'Then' Branch">
    Click the **+** icon next to **"then"** (this runs when condition is met)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Action Button">
    Select **Action** from the options
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Action Type">
    In the right panel, find and select:

    **Add customer tags**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Tag Name">
    In the tag field on the right, enter: **VIP**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 6: Save and Enable

<Steps>
  <Step title="Save Workflow">
    Click **Save** in the top panel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Workflow">
    Enter a descriptive name like "Tag VIP Customers"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Workflow">
    Click the **Turn on** or **Enable** button

    Your workflow is now live!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How the Workflow Works

Now when a customer places an order:

1. **Trigger fires**: Order payment is completed
2. **Condition checked**: Is average order amount ≥ $750?
3. **If YES**: Customer gets tagged with "VIP"
4. **If NO**: No action taken

## Add More Complexity

Let's enhance the workflow with additional customer tiers.

### Add Silver Tier

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Plus on 'Otherwise'">
    On the "otherwise" branch (when first condition fails), click **+**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Another Condition">
    Select **Condition**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Amount Range">
    Add two conditions:
    - Average order amount **greater than or equal to** 500
    - Average order amount **less than** 750

    Click **Add another condition** to combine them
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Silver Tag">
    On the "then" branch, add action: **Add customer tags**

    Enter tag: **SILVER**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add Bronze Tier

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Final Action">
    On the "otherwise" branch of the second condition, add action: **Add customer tags**

    Enter tag: **BRONZE**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save** to update your workflow
  </Step>
</Steps>

Now all customers are automatically categorized:
- **VIP**: Average order ≥ $750
- **SILVER**: Average order $500-$749
- **BRONZE**: Average order < $500

## Add a Delay

Delays let you schedule when actions execute.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Plus Icon">
    Where you want to add a delay, click **+**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Delay Button">
    Select **Delay** from the options
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Time Interval">
    Choose the time type (hours or days) and enter the value

    Example: 2 hours
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Action After Delay">
    Click **+** after the delay to add an action that executes after waiting
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Send an Email

Let's send a thank you email to VIP customers.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Delay">
    After the "Add VIP tag" action, add a 2-hour delay
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Email Action">
    After the delay, add action: **Send email**

    Find it under **External** actions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Email">
    In the right panel, fill in:
    - **To**: Use variables like `{{customer.email}}`
    - **Subject**: "Thank You, VIP Customer!"
    - **Message**: Write your personalized message
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Save your workflow and test with a real order
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Variables

Variables insert dynamic data into your workflows.

Common variables:
- `{{customer.email}}` - Customer's email
- `{{customer.first_name}}` - Customer's first name
- `{{order.total_price}}` - Order total
- `{{order.order_number}}` - Order number
- `{{product.title}}` - Product name

<Tip>
Hover over fields in the workflow builder to see available variables for that action.
</Tip>

## Use Templates

Don't want to build from scratch? Start with a template.

  <Step title="Go to Templates Tab">
    In the React Flow dashboard, click the **Templates** tab
