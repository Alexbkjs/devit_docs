## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a workflow?">
    A **workflow** is an automated sequence of actions triggered by specific events in your store.

    In React Flow, workflows consist of:
    - **Trigger**: The event that starts the workflow (e.g., order created)
    - **Condition**: Rules that determine if actions should run (e.g., order amount > $100)
    - **Action**: What happens when conditions are met (e.g., tag customer, send email)

    Example: When a customer places an order (trigger) for $500 or more (condition), tag them as VIP (action).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can React Flow help me save time?">
    React Flow automates repetitive tasks that would otherwise require manual work:

    - **Customer management**: Auto-tag customers based on spending, order count, or behavior
    - **Inventory alerts**: Get notified when stock runs low
    - **Order processing**: Auto-fulfill orders, capture payments, tag high-risk orders
    - **Email automation**: Send thank you messages, reminders, and notifications
    - **Product management**: Hide out-of-stock items, tag new products

    Most users save **5-7 hours per week** by automating routine store management tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What processes can I automate?">
    React Flow can automate virtually any repetitive task in your Shopify store:

    **Customer workflows**:
    - Tag VIP customers
    - Send welcome emails
    - Reward loyal customers
    - Re-engage inactive customers

    **Order workflows**:
    - Capture payments automatically
    - Tag orders by criteria (shipping location, amount, risk level)
    - Send custom order confirmations
    - Alert for high-risk orders

    **Product workflows**:
    - Hide/show products based on inventory
    - Tag products automatically
    - Send restocking alerts
    - Update product metafields

    **Inventory workflows**:
    - Low stock notifications
    - Auto-publish when restocked
    - Track inventory changes

    See [workflow examples](/reactflow/workflows) for specific use cases.
  </Accordion>

## Tracking & Analytics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I track the effectiveness of each workflow?">
    Yes! React Flow provides built-in analytics and monitoring:

    **Activity Page**:
    - View all workflow executions with timestamps
    - See which workflows ran and when
    - Track success and failure rates
    - Review detailed execution logs

    **Workflow Metrics**:
    - Number of runs for each workflow
    - When workflows were last triggered
    - Which actions executed
    - Any errors or issues

    Access analytics from the **Activity** tab in your dashboard.

    See [Activity Page guide](/reactflow/features/activity) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'number of runs' mean?">
    **Number of runs** refers to how many times a workflow has been triggered and executed.

    Each time your workflow:
    1. Gets triggered by an event (order created, customer registered, etc.)
    2. Evaluates its conditions
    3. Executes actions

    ...that counts as **one run**.

    **Example**: If you have a workflow that tags VIP customers, and 50 orders trigger it this month, that's 50 runs.

    Your plan limits are based on runs per month.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What will happen if I reach the limit of available runs?">
    When you reach your plan's run limit:

    1. **Workflows pause automatically**: Active workflows stop executing
    2. **No data is lost**: All workflows and settings are preserved
    3. **Email notification**: You'll receive an alert about reaching the limit
    4. **Options**:
       - **Upgrade plan**: Increase your run limit
       - **Wait for reset**: Limits reset monthly
       - **Optimize workflows**: Reduce unnecessary triggers

    <Tip>
    Monitor your usage in the dashboard to avoid hitting limits unexpectedly.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When do limits reset?">
    Run limits reset based on your **billing cycle**:

    - **Monthly plans**: Limits reset on the same day each month you started your subscription
    - **Example**: If you subscribed on the 15th, limits reset on the 15th of each month

    You can view:
    - Current usage
    - Limit reset date
    - Remaining runs

    ...in your React Flow dashboard.
