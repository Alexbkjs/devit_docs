## Understanding Workflow Runs

A **workflow run** occurs each time a workflow is triggered and executes. For example:

- Customer places order → Workflow runs once
- 100 customers place orders → Workflow runs 100 times
- Order paid + Order fulfilled (2 workflows) for same order → 2 runs

Your plan includes a set number of runs per month. Additional runs are charged at the overage rate.

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Choosing the Right Plan

Not sure which plan fits your needs? Here's our recommendation:

- **Pay as you go**: Testing React Flow or have minimal automation needs (< 100 runs/month)
- **Starter**: Small stores with 50-300 orders per month
- **Standard**: Medium stores with 300-3,000 orders per month
- **Professional**: Large stores with 3,000+ orders per month or heavy automation

<Tip>
Start with a lower-tier plan and upgrade as your automation needs grow. You can always change plans based on your actual usage.
