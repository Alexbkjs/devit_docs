React Flow is a powerful Shopify workflow automation app that helps you save time by automating repetitive tasks. Create custom workflows with triggers, conditions, and actions to run your store on autopilot.

## What is React Flow?

React Flow allows you to automate virtually any task in your Shopify store by creating workflows - automated sequences of actions triggered by specific events. Whether it's tagging customers, sending emails, managing inventory, or processing orders, React Flow handles the routine so you can focus on growth.

<Note>
**Save up to 7 hours per week** by automating routine tasks like customer tagging, inventory management, email notifications, and order processing.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Trigger">
    Select an event that starts the workflow (order created, customer registered, product added, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Conditions">
    Set rules to determine when actions should execute (order amount, customer tags, inventory levels, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Actions">
    Choose what happens when conditions are met (send email, add tags, update inventory, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable & Monitor">
    Activate your workflow and track performance with built-in analytics
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Workflow Components

React Flow workflows consist of three key components working together:

- **Triggers**: Events that start workflows (order created, customer registered, etc.)
- **Conditions**: Rules that determine when actions execute (order amount, customer tags, etc.)
- **Actions**: Changes made in your store or external systems (send email, add tags, etc.)

Learn more about each component in our detailed guides below.
