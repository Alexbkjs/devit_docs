Get quick answers to the most frequently asked questions about Email Bot.

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does the Email Bot send any emails?">
    No, it does not. Email Bot only **receives and forwards** emails to Discord channels. It cannot send outgoing emails.

    If you need to reply to emails, you can enable the Reply functionality which forwards your Discord messages back to the email sender.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the Email Bot store attachments?">
    No, Email Bot **does not store attachments** on our servers. All attachments are forwarded directly to your Discord channel through Discord's infrastructure. We don't keep copies of files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the Email Bot store the body of emails?">
    Yes, but only for display purposes. Since Discord cannot render HTML email markup directly, the email body is stored on our servers for **3 months** to enable the web version feature.

    This allows you to view the full HTML-formatted email in a browser when needed. After 3 months, the email body is automatically deleted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add the bot to all my channels?">
    Yes! Email Bot generates **unique email addresses for every integration**. You can create as many integrations as you need across all your channels.

    Each channel gets its own dedicated email address, perfect for organizing different types of notifications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I remove the bot from a channel if I don't need it anymore?">
    Yes, you can disconnect the bot at any time:
    1. Use the `/list` command in the channel
    2. Click the **Disconnect** button
    3. Confirm the disconnection

    The unique email address for that channel will be deactivated.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Email Forwarding

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is it possible to set up forwarding from an existing email address?">
    Yes! You can forward emails from services like Gmail, Outlook, or any other email provider to the bot's unique address.

    **For Gmail**:
    Follow Google's guide: [Automatically forward Gmail messages](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957)

    **General steps**:
    1. Open your email provider's settings
    2. Find forwarding or filters section
    3. Add the bot's email as a forwarding destination
    4. Verify the forwarding address if required
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What should I do if my email didn't appear in the Discord channel?">
    First, check our [troubleshooting guide](/email/support/troubleshooting) for detailed solutions.

    **Quick checks**:
    - Verify you sent to the correct email address (use `/list` to confirm)
    - Check if email was caught in your spam folder
    - Ensure the bot has permission to post in the channel
    - Wait a few minutes - high volumes may be queued
    - Check email size doesn't exceed limits (30MB total)

    If the issue persists, contact [support@devit.software](mailto:support@devit.software).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do emails appear instantly or is there a delay?">
    Emails typically appear within seconds. However, delivery may be delayed due to:
    - **Rate limiting**: 2 emails/second, 100/minute (varies by subscription)
    - **Queue processing**: High-volume bursts are queued
    - **Discord API limits**: Technical limitations of Discord's platform

    All emails are delivered in order. Nothing is lost - just potentially delayed during high volume.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features & Functionality

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I reply to emails from Discord?">
    Yes, when you enable the **Message Reply Option**:
    1. Use `/list` command
    2. Go to Settings → Message Reply Option
    3. Enable the feature

    Once enabled, team members can reply to emails directly from Discord, and those replies will be sent back to the original email sender.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see the full HTML version of emails?">
    Yes! Enable the **Web Version of Emails** feature:
    1. Use `/list` command
    2. Go to Settings → Web version of emails
    3. Enable the feature

    Each email will include a link to view the full HTML-formatted version in a browser. This is perfect for newsletters and richly formatted emails.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize how the sender's name appears?">
    Yes, use the **Email Personalization** feature:
    - Set a custom bot name to replace sender email addresses

    - Choose whether to display email avatars

    See our [Email Personalization guide](/email/features/personalization) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I filter which emails get forwarded?">
    While Email Bot forwards all emails sent to its unique address, you can control what gets sent to it:

    - Use Gmail filters to forward only specific emails
    - Set up rules in your email provider
    - Create different bot integrations for different email types
    - Use separate email addresses for different purposes

    Email Bot itself doesn't have built-in filtering - control happens at the email provider level.
