If you're experiencing issues with Email bot, this guide will help you identify and fix the most common problems.

## Connection to Channel Failed

If the Email bot stops working, you may see this message when trying to connect it to a channel:

> ❌ **Connection to the channel failed, please contact the developer.**

This usually indicates that the bot's existing connection is in a broken or inconsistent state. In most cases, you can restore normal operation by disconnecting and reconnecting the bot.

### Step 1: Disconnect the Email Bot

Follow these steps directly in the affected channel:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the list command">
    Type `/list` in the channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Locate the Email bot">
    Find **Email bot** in the list of connected integrations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Disconnect">
    Click the **Disconnect** button next to the Email bot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm disconnection">
    Confirm the disconnection when prompted
  </Step>
</Steps>

This fully resets the bot's connection to the channel.

### Step 2: Reconnect the Email Bot

After the bot is disconnected:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the connect command">
    Type `/connect` in the channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Email bot">
    Select or confirm the **Email bot** connection from the list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Once completed, the bot should reconnect successfully and resume normal operation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This disconnect → reconnect process resolves the issue in the majority of cases and is the recommended first step whenever the Email bot connection fails.
</Note>

### If the Issue Persists

If you still see the same error after reconnecting:

<AccordionGroup>

    **Verify** that you have permission to manage integrations in the channel.

    **How to check**:

    2. Ensure you have "Manage Webhooks" or "Administrator" permissions
    3. Ask a server administrator if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Workspace-Level Restrictions" icon="building">
    **Verify** that the bot has not been removed or restricted at the workspace level.

    **How to check**:

    2. Navigate to Integrations
    3. Verify Email bot appears in the list
    4. Check that it's not disabled or restricted

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Emails Not Appearing in Channel

If you've connected the bot successfully but emails aren't showing up:

### Check Email Forwarding Setup

Ensure that emails are being forwarded correctly to the bot's address.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify forwarding address">
    Check that you're using the correct email address provided by the bot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the connection">
    Send a test email to verify the forwarding works
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check spam/junk folders">
    The forwarding rule may be catching emails before they reach the bot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    It may take a few minutes for emails to appear in the channel
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Check Bot Permissions

The bot needs proper permissions to post messages in the channel.

**Required permissions**:
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Attach Files (for email attachments)
- Read Message History

### Review Rate Limits

Discord has rate limits that may affect how quickly emails appear.

<Warning>
If you're receiving a large volume of emails in a short period, some messages may be delayed or queued. This is a Discord limitation, not a bot issue.
</Warning>

**What to expect**:
- Normal operation: Emails appear within 1-2 minutes
- High volume: May take up to 5-10 minutes during rate limiting
- If delays persist beyond this, check your forwarding setup

## Display Issues

### Emails Showing in Wrong Format

If emails appear but don't look right:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check display mode">
    Use `/list` to see current display settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust display mode">
    See available display modes in the [Display Modes guide](/email/features/display-modes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test different formats">
    Try switching between compact and full display modes
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Attachments Not Appearing

If email attachments are missing:

**Common causes**:
- Attachment exceeds Discord's file size limit (25MB for free users, 500MB for Nitro)
- File type is not supported by Discord
- Bot lacks "Attach Files" permission

**Solutions**:
1. Verify bot has "Attach Files" permission in the channel
2. Check attachment file size
3. Large files will show as links instead of embedded attachments
