Email Bot uses Discord's slash command system for all interactions. Here's a complete reference of available commands.

## Core Commands

### /connect

Creates a unique email address for the current channel.

**Usage**:
```
/connect
```

**What happens**:
1. Bot generates a unique email address for the channel
2. Returns the email address in format: `channel-id@email.devit.software`
3. Activates email forwarding to that channel
4. No configuration needed - works immediately

**Example**:
```
You: /connect

Bot: ✅ Email connection created!

Your channel email address:
📧 123456789@email.devit.software

Any emails sent to this address will appear in this channel.
```

**Notes**:
- Each channel gets its own unique email address
- You can connect the bot to multiple channels
- The email address never expires unless you disconnect
- If already connected, shows existing email address
