description: Forward emails to Discord channels with a unique email address. Perfect for notifications, support tickets, and team communication.

Email Bot is a powerful Discord integration that generates unique email addresses for your channels. Any emails sent to these addresses are automatically forwarded and displayed in Discord, keeping your team connected and organized.

## What is Email Bot?

Email Bot creates a bridge between email and Discord, allowing you to:
- Receive emails directly in Discord channels
- Subscribe to notifications from any service
- Centralize communication in one place
- Track email conversations with your team

<Note>
**How it works**: Connect the bot to a channel → Get a unique email address → Any emails sent to that address appear in the channel
</Note>
