Get quick answers to the most frequently asked questions about Telegram Bot.

## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if a customer replies to an old thread?">
    If the thread is **more than 24 hours old**, a new thread will be created automatically. Otherwise, the customer's reply will be added to the existing thread.

    This behavior prevents thread clutter while keeping recent conversations organized.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does your bot store messages?">
    No, our application **does not store your messages**. Messages are forwarded in real-time between Telegram and Discord without being saved on our servers.

    Message history exists only in Discord threads and Telegram chats.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="If my customer uses an attachment, will I see it in Discord?">
    Yes! All messages are forwarded with their attached content, including:
    - Files and documents
    - Images and photos
    - Videos
    - Voice messages
    - Audio files
    - Stickers
    - Emojis

    Everything that appears in Telegram will appear in Discord.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I remove an integration?">
    To disconnect a Telegram bot integration:
    1. Use the `/disconnect` command in the Discord channel
    2. Confirm the disconnection

    Alternatively, use `/list` and click the **Disconnect** button.

    After disconnecting, messages will no longer forward from Telegram to Discord.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Display & Appearance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is my Telegram avatar not displayed in Discord?">
    This is due to Telegram privacy settings. To allow avatars to display:

    **In Telegram**:
    1. Go to Settings → Privacy and Security → Profile Photo
    2. Set it to **"Everybody"**

    OR

    Add an exception for your specific bot or group in the privacy settings.

    Without these permissions, Discord cannot access the user's profile photo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is Full Name displayed instead of Username?">
    In Telegram:
    - **First Name** is mandatory (everyone must have one)
    - **Username** is optional (not all users set one)

    The bot displays usernames when available using variables like `{{username}}` or `{{name}}`. If a user hasn't set a username, Telegram displays their first name by default.

    This is expected behavior based on Telegram's user profile structure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize how messages appear in Discord?">
    Yes! Use the Settings menu (access via `/list`):
    - **New Message Notification**: Customize notification behavior
    - **Message Forwarding**: Configure forwarding options
    - **Message Filters**: Filter which messages to forward
    - **Greeting Message Notification**: Set automatic greetings
    - **Other Settings**: Additional customization options

    See our [Settings documentation](/telegram/features/settings) for details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Telegram Groups and Channels

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I forward messages from a Telegram group to Discord?">
    To forward Telegram group messages:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Bot to Group">
        Add your Telegram bot to the desired group
      </Step>
      <Step title="Grant Admin Rights">
        Make the bot an administrator with message viewing permissions

        **Required permissions**:
        - View messages
        - Send messages
        - Send media
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect in Discord">
        Use `/connect [token]` in your Discord channel
      </Step>
      <Step title="Messages Forward">
        All group messages now appear in Discord
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    The bot **must have admin rights** in the Telegram group to view and forward messages. Without admin permissions, the bot cannot access group content.
    </Warning>

    See our detailed [Group Forwarding guide](/telegram/features/group-forwarding).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I forward messages from a Telegram channel to Discord?">
    To forward Telegram channel posts:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Add Bot to Channel">
        Add your Telegram bot to the channel as an administrator
      </Step>
      <Step title="Grant Admin Rights">
        Provide admin permissions for message access
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect in Discord">
        Use `/connect [token]` in Discord
      </Step>
      <Step title="Posts Forward">
        Channel posts automatically appear in Discord
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
    Channel forwarding requires the bot to have admin rights in the Telegram channel.
    </Warning>

    See our detailed [Channel Forwarding guide](/telegram/features/channel-forwarding).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I forward from multiple groups to the same Discord channel?">
    Yes, but be aware that all messages from different Telegram groups will be mixed together in the same Discord channel.

    **Better approach**:
    Create separate Discord channels for each Telegram group:
    - `#telegram-group-1` → Telegram Group A
    - `#telegram-group-2` → Telegram Group B
    - `#telegram-group-3` → Telegram Channel C

    This keeps conversations organized and easier to manage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What Discord permissions does the bot need?">
    **Required permissions**:
    - View Channels
    - Send Messages
    - Send Messages in Threads
    - Create Public Threads
    - Embed Links
    - Attach Files

    **Recommended permissions**:
    - Manage Threads (for better thread control)
    - Read Message History (for reply functionality)
    - Use External Emojis (for sticker support)

    Without these permissions, the bot may not function properly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What Telegram permissions does the bot need?">
    **For bot DMs**: No special permissions needed

    **For groups and channels**: Bot must be an administrator with:
    - View/Read messages
    - Send messages
    - Send media
    - Manage messages (recommended)

    The bot cannot forward messages from groups/channels without admin rights.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a message limit?">
    There are no hard message limits, but:
    - Very high message volumes may experience slight delays
    - Discord API rate limits apply (handled automatically)
    - Messages are queued and delivered in order during high traffic

    For most use cases, you won't notice any limitations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple Telegram bots in one Discord server?">
    Yes! You can connect multiple Telegram bots to different Discord channels within the same server.

    **Example setup**:
    - Support Bot → #telegram-support
    - Community Bot → #telegram-community
    - Announcements Bot → #telegram-news

    Each integration operates independently with its own settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy & Security

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my bot token secure?">
    Yes. Bot tokens are:
    - Encrypted during transmission
    - Stored securely on our servers
    - Never shared or exposed publicly
    - Only used to connect to your Telegram bot

    Always keep your token private and never share it publicly. If compromised, regenerate a new token in BotFather.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you see my messages?">
    No. Messages are forwarded directly between Telegram and Discord without being stored on our servers. We cannot read or access your conversation content.

    The bot acts as a real-time relay, not a message storage system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What data do you collect?">
    We collect minimal data required for functionality:
    - Bot tokens (encrypted)
    - Connection metadata (which Discord channel, which Telegram bot)
    - Basic usage statistics for service improvement

    We do NOT collect or store:
    - Message content
    - Attachments
    - User conversation history
    - Personal information beyond what's necessary for the integration
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
