---

Telegram Bot uses Discord's slash command system for managing integrations. Here's a complete reference of available commands.

## Core Commands

### /connect

Connects a Telegram bot to the current Discord channel.

**Usage**:
```
/connect [token]
```

**Parameters**:
- `token`: Your Telegram bot token from BotFather

**Example**:
```
/connect 123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz
```

**What happens**:
1. Bot validates the Telegram token
2. Establishes connection between Telegram and Discord
3. Activates message forwarding
4. Creates threads for incoming Telegram conversations

**Response**:
```
✅ Connected successfully!

Your Telegram bot is now linked to this channel.
Telegram conversations will appear as threads here.

Bot username: @your_bot_name
Status: Active
```

<Warning>
Keep your bot token secret! Anyone with this token can control your Telegram bot. Never share it publicly.
</Warning>

**Notes**:
- One Discord channel can connect to one Telegram bot
- Multiple Discord channels can connect to different Telegram bots
- Connection persists until you use `/disconnect`

### /list

Displays all connected Telegram bots and their settings.

**Usage**:
```
/list
```

**What it shows**:
- Connected Telegram bot username
- Integration status (active/inactive)
- Quick access buttons:

### /disconnect

Removes a Telegram bot integration from the channel.

4. Token is removed from the system

This will stop forwarding messages from Telegram to this channel.
Existing threads will remain.

## Telegram Bot Commands

You can also interact with your Telegram bot directly in Telegram:

Initiates conversation with the bot.

**Usage in Telegram**:
```
/start
```

**Response**: Bot sends greeting message (if configured)

### Custom Commands

You can add custom commands to your Telegram bot via BotFather:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Message BotFather">
    Open BotFather in Telegram
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use /setcommands">
    Send `/setcommands` to BotFather
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Bot">
    Choose the bot to configure
  </Step>

    Example:
    ```
    help - Get help
    support - Contact support
    status - Check bot status
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

These custom commands will appear in Telegram's command menu but won't affect Discord forwarding.
