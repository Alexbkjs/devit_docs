description: Understand how Telegram conversations are organized into Discord threads and how to manage them effectively.
---

Telegram Bot uses Discord's threading feature to organize conversations, keeping each Telegram chat separate and manageable. Learn how thread creation works and best practices for organization.

## How Threading Works

### New Conversations

When a new Telegram user messages your bot:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Message Received">
    Telegram user sends first message to your bot
  </Step>
  <Step title="Thread Created">
    Discord bot creates a new thread in the connected channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Thread Named">
    Thread name set to Telegram user's name/username
  </Step>
  <Step title="Message Posted">
    First message appears in the thread
  </Step>
  <Step title="Avatar Displayed">
    User's Telegram avatar shows in thread (if privacy allows)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Thread naming format**:
- If user has @username: `@username`
- If no username: User's first name
- Customizable via settings

### Ongoing Conversations

When an existing user sends another message:

**If thread is less than 24 hours old**:
- Message added to existing thread
- Thread bumped to top of channel
- Notification sent (if enabled)

**If thread is older than 24 hours**:
- New thread created
- Original thread remains archived
- Prevents thread clutter

<Tip>
Adjust the 24-hour threshold in Settings → Message Forwarding → Thread Duration
</Tip>

## Thread Modes

Choose how conversations are organized:

### Auto-Create Threads (Recommended)

**Behavior**: Each Telegram user gets their own thread

**Advantages**:
- Clean organization
- Easy to track individual conversations
- Team members can pick up any conversation
- Searchable by user

**Best for**:
- Customer support
- Help desk
- Community management
- Multi-user conversations

**Example**:
```
#telegram-support
  └─ Thread: @customer1
  └─ Thread: @customer2
  └─ Thread: @support_inquiry
```

### Single Thread Mode

**Behavior**: All messages forward to one designated thread

**Advantages**:
- Simple setup
- All messages in one place
- No thread proliferation

**Best for**:
- Low volume forwarding
- Personal bot monitoring
- Single-purpose bots

**Example**:
```
#telegram-monitor
  └─ Thread: All Conversations
      ├─ Message from @user1
      ├─ Message from @user2
      └─ Message from @user3
```

### No Threads (Channel Mode)

**Behavior**: Messages post directly in channel

**Advantages**:
- Maximum visibility
- No clicking into threads
- Chronological feed

**Best for**:
- Announcements only
- Read-only monitoring
- Archive purposes

**Example**:
```
#telegram-feed
  ├─ Message from @announcer
  ├─ Message from @news_bot
  └─ Message from @updates
```

## Thread Naming Strategies

Customize how threads are named:

### By Username (Default)

**Format**: `@username`

**Pros**:
- Unique identifier
- Easy to search
- Professional

**Cons**:
- Not all users have usernames
- Falls back to first name

### By First Name

**Format**: `John`

**Pros**:
- More personal
- Always available

**Cons**:
- May not be unique
- Less searchable

### By Full Name

**Format**: `John Doe`

**Pros**:
- Complete identification
- More unique than first name

**Cons**:
- Some users only set first name

### Custom Format

**Format**: `Support - @username` or `[VIP] John Doe`

**How to set**:
1. Settings → Message Forwarding → Thread Name Format
2. Use variables: `{username}`, `{first_name}`, `{last_name}`
3. Add prefixes: `Support - {username}`
4. Add categories: `[{category}] {first_name}`

**Examples**:
```
Support - @customer123
[Premium] John Doe
Inquiry from @user_name
```

## Managing Active Threads

### Replying to Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Thread">
    Click on the thread for the conversation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type Response">
    Type your message in the thread (not main channel!)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send">
    Press Enter - message forwards to Telegram user
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Always reply **inside the thread**, not in the main channel. Messages in main channel won't forward to Telegram.
</Warning>

### Closing/Archiving Threads

**Manual Archive**:
1. Right-click thread
2. Select "Archive Thread"
3. Thread hidden from active view
4. Accessible in "Archived Threads"

**Auto-Archive**:
- Threads auto-archive after configured inactivity period
- Default: 24 hours
- Adjustable in settings

### Locking Threads

Prevent further messages in resolved conversations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Thread">
    Navigate to the conversation thread
  </Step>
  <Step title="Thread Settings">
    Click thread name → Thread Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lock Thread">
    Toggle "Locked" on
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Effect**: Team can't send messages, but can still view history

**Use cases**:
- Resolved support tickets
- Completed conversations
- Archived inquiries

## Group and Channel Threading

### Telegram Groups

**Default behavior**: Each group creates one thread

**Thread name**: Telegram group name

**Messages**:
- All group messages appear in single thread
- Sender name shows in each message
- Replies go to entire group

### Telegram Channels

**Default behavior**: Channel posts create individual messages or threads

**Options**:
- **Thread per post**: Each channel message gets own thread
- **Single thread**: All posts in one thread
- **No threads**: Posts directly in channel

## Troubleshooting Threads

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="New thread for every message">
    **Cause**: Thread duration set too short or user has dynamic username

    **Solution**:
    1. Increase thread duration to 48 hours
    2. Check if user's Telegram name changes frequently
    3. Verify settings are saved correctly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Threads not being created">
    **Cause**: Discord bot lacks thread permissions

    **Solution**:
    1. Check bot has "Create Public Threads" permission
    2. Verify "Send Messages in Threads" permission
    3. Re-invite bot with correct permissions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't reply in thread">
    **Cause**: Thread is archived or locked

    **Solution**:
    1. Unarchive the thread
    2. Unlock if locked
    3. Check bot still connected with `/list`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Messages going to wrong thread">
    **Cause**: Telegram user changed username

    **Solution**:
    - This is normal behavior
    - Bot tracks by Telegram user ID, not username
    - Thread continues correctly even if name changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Thread Workflows

### Customer Support Workflow

```
1. New message creates thread
2. Team member responds in thread
3. Add "In Progress" tag
4. Continue conversation in thread
5. When resolved, add "Resolved" tag
6. Archive thread after 24 hours
```

### Prioritization Workflow

```
1. Monitor incoming threads
2. Pin urgent threads to top
3. Assign team members to threads

5. Review and archive completed threads
```

### Multi-Team Workflow

```
