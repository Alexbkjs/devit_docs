## Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

If you already have a Telegram bot and token, skip to Step 2.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Telegram">
    Launch Telegram on any device (mobile app, desktop, or web)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find BotFather">
    Search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) in Telegram and open the chat

    <Tip>
    BotFather is Telegram's official bot for creating and managing bots. It's verified with a blue checkmark.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start BotFather">
    Click **Start** button or send `/start` command
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create New Bot">
    Send the `/newbot` command to BotFather
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Bot Name">
    BotFather will ask for a name. Enter your bot's display name (e.g., "My Support Bot")

    This is what users will see when they interact with your bot.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Username">
    Enter a username for your bot. Must end with "bot" (e.g., "my_support_bot" or "MyCompanyBot")

    <Note>
    Usernames must be unique across all of Telegram. If your choice is taken, try adding numbers or your company name.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Your Token">
    BotFather provides a token that looks like: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`

    **Copy this token** - you'll need it for the Discord connection.

    <Warning>
    Keep your bot token secret! Anyone with this token can control your bot. Never share it publicly.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Add Discord Bot to Your Server

    Click the **Invite** button to add the bot to your Discord server
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Server">
    Choose which Discord server to add the bot to
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Permissions">
    Review and authorize the required permissions

    The bot needs permissions to create threads, send messages, and attach files.
