Telegram Bot is a powerful Discord integration that bridges Telegram and Discord, allowing you to manage Telegram conversations directly from Discord. Perfect for customer support, community management, and team communication.

## What is Telegram Bot?

Telegram Bot enables you to forward Telegram chats to Discord channels, creating a centralized hub for customer communication. Every Telegram conversation appears as a separate thread in Discord, and your team can reply directly from Discord.

<Note>
**How it works**: Create/connect a Telegram bot → Get token → Connect to Discord with `/connect` command → All Telegram chats forward to Discord threads
</Note>
