title: Payment Compatibility
description: Understand which payment processors and methods work with ReSell post-purchase offers.
---

ReSell post-purchase offers require payment processors that support **payment vaulting** - the ability to securely store and reuse payment information for additional charges. This guide explains which payment methods are compatible.

## How Post-Purchase Payments Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Checkout">
    Customer completes checkout and payment for original order
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Vaulted">
    Payment processor securely stores payment information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer Displayed">
    ReSell shows post-purchase offer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer Accepts">
    Customer clicks "Add to Order" (one-click)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Charge">
    Payment processor charges vaulted payment method for upsell
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
ReSell never stores or accesses payment information. All payment processing is handled securely through Shopify's payment system.
</Note>

## Partially Compatible Methods

These payment methods work in some scenarios but have limitations:

### PayPal Express Checkout

**Compatibility**: ⚠️ Limited

**Works when**:
- Used alongside Shopify Payments
- Shopify Payments is enabled as backup processor
- Customer paid with card through PayPal

**Doesn't work when**:
- PayPal is the only payment method
- Customer paid using PayPal balance
- PayPal account is funding source (not card)

**Recommendation**: Enable Shopify Payments alongside PayPal for best compatibility

### Wallet Services (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Shop Pay)

**Compatibility**: ⚠️ Limited

**Works when**:
- Underlying processor supports vaulting (e.g., Shopify Payments)
- Card is saved to Shopify customer account
- Customer is logged in

**Doesn't work when**:
- Guest checkout with wallet
- One-time wallet payment
- Processor doesn't support vaulting

**Behavior**: Offers may not display for wallet-only transactions

## Incompatible Payment Methods

These payment methods do NOT support post-purchase offers:

### Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)

**Compatibility**: ❌ Not supported

**Services**:
- Klarna
- Affirm
- Afterpay
- Sezzle
- Zip

**Why not supported**: These services don't support vaulting or additional charges after initial approval

**Impact**: Customers using BNPL will not see post-purchase offers

### Alternative Payment Methods

**Compatibility**: ❌ Not supported

**Methods**:
- Amazon Pay
- Cash on Delivery (COD)
- Bank transfer
- Cryptocurrency payments
- Manual payment methods

**Why not supported**: No automated charge capability

### Gift Cards Only

**Compatibility**: ❌ Not supported

**Scenario**: Customer pays entirely with gift card balance

**Why not supported**: No payment method to charge for additional items

**Workaround**: If customer uses gift card + credit card, post-purchase offers work (credit card is charged)

## Payment Method Priority

If a customer's order was paid with multiple methods, ReSell charges in this priority:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Primary Card">
    Credit or debit card used at checkout
  </Step>
  <Step title="Vaulted Payment">
    Saved payment method on customer account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Default Method">
    Customer's default payment method (if logged in)
  </Step>
</Steps>

  <Step title="Create Test Funnel">
    Set up a simple funnel with one upsell offer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Place Test Order">

## Troubleshooting Payment Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Offers not showing for certain customers">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Customer used incompatible payment method
    - Customer paid with gift card only
    - Payment processor doesn't support vaulting

    **Solution**: Check which payment method was used in Shopify order details
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Upsell payment failed">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Card declined (insufficient funds, expired card)
    - Payment method no longer valid
    - Fraud detection triggered

    **Solution**: This creates a "partially paid" order. Customer receives notification to update payment, or you can remove the unpaid item.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent offer display">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Mix of compatible and incompatible payment methods
    - Some customers using wallets, others using cards

    **Solution**: Review analytics to see what percentage of customers are using compatible methods. Consider offering alternative payment options.
