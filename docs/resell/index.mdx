title: Welcome to ReSell
description: Boost your Shopify store sales with intelligent post-purchase upsell and cross-sell offers.
---

ReSell is a powerful Shopify app designed to increase your average order value (AOV) through strategic post-purchase upsell and cross-sell offers. Display personalized product recommendations at key moments in the customer journey—after purchase, during checkout, and on order status pages.

## What is ReSell?

ReSell enables you to create intelligent sales funnels that display additional product offers to customers who have just completed a purchase. These risk-free offers allow customers to add products to their order with one click, without re-entering payment information.

<Note>
**Key benefit**: Increase your revenue without spending more on customer acquisition. Sell more to customers who are already engaged and ready to buy.
