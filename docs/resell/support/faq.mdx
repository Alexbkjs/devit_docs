## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a post-purchase offer?" icon="circle-question">
    Post-purchase offers are additional sales pages displayed to customers **after** they complete their purchase, but **before** they reach the Thank You page.

    Customers can accept offers with one click without re-entering payment information. The additional products are automatically charged using the payment method already on file.

    **Example**: A customer buys a phone case. After completing checkout, they see an offer for a screen protector at 15% off. With one click, the screen protector is added to their order and charged automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many funnels can I create with ReSell?" icon="filter">
    **Unlimited!** There's no limit on the number of funnels you can create with ReSell, regardless of your plan.

    You can create separate funnels for:
    - Different products or collections
    - Different customer segments
    - Different seasons or promotions
    - Different geographic regions
    - Testing different offers (A/B testing)

    Best practice: Start with 3-5 well-targeted funnels and expand based on performance data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many offers can I show to my customer?" icon="list">
    Customers can see up to **two additional products** through the post-purchase funnel:

    **Offer Sequence**:
    1. **Upsell Offer #1**: Shown first
    2. If accepted → **Upsell Offer #2**: Second offer appears
    3. If declined → **Downsell Offer**: Alternative offer shown instead

    Additionally, you can show offers on:
    - Thank You page (promotional content)
    - Order Status page (tracking page)
    - Checkout page (Shopify Plus only)
    - POS terminal (in-store)

    <Note>
    Limit post-purchase offers to 2-3 products maximum to avoid overwhelming customers. Too many offers can reduce conversion rates.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I get a demo of the ReSell app?" icon="presentation-screen">
    Yes! You can:

    1. **Install the free plan**: Test all features risk-free with our free plan
    2. **View live demo**: Visit our website for interactive demos
    3. **Request personal demo**: Email [support@devit.software](mailto:support@devit.software) to schedule a personalized walkthrough

    We recommend installing the app and creating a test funnel to see exactly how it works in your store.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Payment & Checkout

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do customers need to re-enter payment information?" icon="credit-card">
    **No!** That's the beauty of post-purchase offers.

    When a customer accepts an offer, ReSell automatically charges their payment method using the secure payment information already collected during checkout. This creates a frictionless, one-click experience.

    <Info>
    Payment information is securely processed through Shopify's payment system. ReSell never stores or accesses sensitive payment data.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which payment methods are supported by ReSell?" icon="money-check-dollar">
    ReSell works with most Shopify payment processors that support **payment vaulting** (storing payment information for future charges).

    **Supported Processors**:
    - Shopify Payments (recommended)
    - Stripe
    - Braintree (with vaulting enabled)
    - Authorize.Net
    - Many others supporting vaulting

    **Not Supported**:
    - PayPal Express Checkout (without Shopify Payments)
    - Third-party processors requiring CVV storage
    - Wallet services (Apple Pay, Google Pay, Amazon Pay)
    - Buy Now, Pay Later services (Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay)
    - Gift card-only payments

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does the post-purchase upsell affect my fulfillment?" icon="truck">
    Post-purchase offers are added to the **original order** as additional line items. This means:

    **Order Processing**:
    - All items (original + upsell) appear as one order in Shopify admin
    - Single order number for customer and fulfillment team
    - Single packing slip includes all items
    - Shipping is calculated based on total order

    **Benefits**:
    - Simplified fulfillment process
    - No separate orders to track
    - Combined shipping saves costs
    - Better customer experience

    **Important**: Accepted offers appear within seconds of the original order, so they're typically picked and packed together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are partially paid orders?" icon="receipt">
    Partially paid orders occur when:
    1. Customer completes initial checkout ✓
    2. Post-purchase offer is accepted ✓
    3. Payment for upsell **fails** ✗

    This creates an order where the original purchase is paid, but the upsell item remains unpaid.

    **How ReSell Handles This**:
    - Original purchase is **always** processed and fulfilled
    - Failed upsell item is marked as unpaid
    - Customer receives email notification about payment failure
    - You can send payment request through Shopify admin
    - Or remove the unpaid item from the order

    **Prevention**: ReSell validates payment methods before showing offers, minimizing failed payments.

  <Accordion title="How does auto recommendation work?" icon="robot">
    Auto recommendations use **Shopify's built-in product recommendation engine** to automatically suggest relevant products based on:

    **Data Sources**:
    - Purchase history patterns
    - Product relationships
    - Customer browsing behavior
    - Similar product attributes
    - Complementary products

    **How It Works**:
    1. Customer adds product to cart and checks out
    2. ReSell queries Shopify's recommendation API
    3. Shopify returns best-matched products
    4. ReSell displays top recommendation in your offer

    **Pros**:
    - Zero manual configuration
    - Improves over time with more data
    - Considers store-wide patterns
    - Always relevant suggestions

    **Cons**:
    - Less control over specific products
    - Requires sufficient store data to work well
    - May not align with your promotional strategy

    <Tip>
    Use auto recommendations for broad "any product" funnels, and manual selection for strategic upsells on key products.
    </Tip>
