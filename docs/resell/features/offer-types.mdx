ReSell supports three types of offers to maximize your average order value. Each type serves a different purpose in your sales funnel strategy.

## Upsell Offers

Encourage customers to purchase additional quantities or upgraded versions of products they just bought.

### When to Use

- Customer bought a single item
- Higher-value alternative available
- Bulk purchase makes sense
- Premium version exists

### Examples

**Quantity Upsell**:
- Customer buys 1 coffee mug → Offer 2 mugs at 10% discount
- Customer buys 1 t-shirt → Offer 3-pack bundle

**Upgrade Upsell**:
- Customer buys basic plan → Offer premium plan upgrade
- Customer buys standard product → Offer deluxe version

**Add-On Upsell**:
- Customer buys camera → Offer extended warranty
- Customer buys software → Offer premium support package

### Best Practices

## Cross-Sell Offers

Suggest complementary products that enhance the customer's original purchase.

### When to Use

- Related accessories available
- Commonly bought together
- Complete the solution
- Enhance product usage

### Examples

**Complementary Products**:
- Customer buys phone → Offer phone case and screen protector
- Customer buys camera → Offer memory card and camera bag

**Complete the Look**:
- Customer buys dress → Offer matching shoes and accessories
- Customer buys sofa → Offer throw pillows and coffee table

**Consumables & Refills**:
- Customer buys coffee maker → Offer coffee pods subscription
- Customer buys printer → Offer ink cartridges

**Bundle Deals**:

## Downsell Offers

Present an alternative offer when customers decline your initial upsell, typically with a larger discount or different product.

### When to Use

- Customer declined first offer
- Price was the objection
- Different product might appeal
- Last chance to increase AOV

### Examples

**Lower Price Point**:
- Decline $50 product → Offer $25 alternative
- Decline premium → Offer standard version at discount

**Higher Discount**:
- Decline 10% off → Offer 20% off same product
- Decline full price → Offer limited-time deeper discount

**Different Product**:
- Decline expensive accessory → Offer budget-friendly alternative
- Decline subscription → Offer one-time purchase option

**Sample/Trial**:
- Decline full product → Offer sample size at discount
- Decline annual plan → Offer monthly trial

## Funnel Strategy

Combine all three offer types in a strategic sequence:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Upsell">
    Customer completes purchase → Show premium upsell (higher value/quantity)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Accept Path">
    If accepted → Proceed to thank you page (optional: show cross-sell)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decline Path">
    If declined → Show downsell (lower price point or higher discount)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Final Cross-Sell">
    After downsell response → Show complementary product cross-sell
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    Proceed to thank you page
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Offer Performance Tips

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics for each offer type:

|--------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Acceptance Rate | 15-25% | 10-20% | 20-30% |
| AOV Increase | $10-30 | $15-25 | $5-15 |
