title: Offer Placement
description: Understand where ReSell offers can appear in the customer journey and which placements work best.
---

ReSell can display offers at multiple touchpoints in the customer journey. Each placement has different characteristics and conversion rates.

## Available Placements

### Post-Purchase Page

Display offers immediately after payment confirmation, before the thank you page.

**Characteristics**:
- **Timing**: Right after checkout completion
- **Customer State**: Highest engagement, payment info still active
- **One-Click**: Add to order without re-entering payment
- **Conversion Rate**: Highest (15-30%)

**Best For**:
- Primary upsell offers
- High-value cross-sells
- Time-sensitive promotions

**How It Works**:
1. Customer completes checkout and payment
2. Instead of going directly to thank you page, they see your offer
3. They can accept (one-click add to order) or decline
4. Then proceed to thank you page

<Note>
This is the most effective placement and is available on all Shopify plans.
</Note>

### Checkout Page (Shopify Plus Only)

Show offers during the checkout process before payment.

**Characteristics**:

## Choosing the Right Placement

### For Maximum Conversion

**Use**: Post-Purchase Page

**Why**: Customers just completed payment, engagement is highest, and one-click ordering removes friction.

**Strategy**: Your main upsell and cross-sell offers should appear here.

### For Shopify Plus Merchants

**Use**: Checkout + Post-Purchase

**Why**: Catch customers at two high-intent moments.

**Strategy**:
- **Checkout**: Low-cost add-ons and accessories
- **Post-Purchase**: Higher-value upsells

### For Brand Building

**Use**: Thank You + Order Status

**Why**: Low pressure, builds goodwill, focuses on discovery.

**Strategy**: Promote new products, collect reviews, offer referral incentives.

### For Retail Stores

**Use**: POS Terminal

**Why**: Staff can personally recommend items face-to-face.

**Strategy**: Train staff on which products to upsell for different purchases.

## Technical Considerations

- Some payment methods have limitations (see [Payment Compatibility](/resell/advanced/payment-compatibility))
- Must be enabled in ReSell settings

### Checkout Requirements

- Shopify Plus plan required
- Checkout extensibility enabled
- Theme compatibility (modern themes work best)

### Theme Compatibility

Most modern Shopify themes work seamlessly with ReSell. If you have a custom or older theme, test thoroughly:

1. Create test funnels
2. Make test purchases
3. Verify offers appear correctly
