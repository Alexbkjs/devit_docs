title: Auto Recommendations
description: Use AI-powered product recommendations to automatically suggest relevant upsells and cross-sells.
---

Auto recommendations leverage Shopify's intelligent product recommendation engine to automatically suggest the most relevant products to each customer. No manual product selection needed.

## How Auto Recommendations Work

Instead of manually choosing which products to offer, auto recommendations use Shopify's data to dynamically select the best products for each customer:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Completes Purchase">
    Customer checks out with product(s)
  </Step>
  <Step title="ReSell Queries Shopify">
    ReSell asks Shopify's recommendation API for related products
  </Step>
  <Step title="Shopify Analyzes Data">
    Shopify analyzes purchase patterns, product relationships, and customer behavior
  </Step>
  <Step title="Best Match Returned">
    Shopify returns the most relevant product recommendation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Offer Displayed">
    ReSell shows the recommended product in your offer
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Auto recommendations require sufficient store data to work effectively. New stores or products with limited sales history may receive less accurate recommendations.
</Note>

## What Powers Auto Recommendations

Shopify's recommendation engine analyzes:

### Purchase Patterns

**Frequently bought together**: Products that customers often purchase in the same order.

**Example**: Customer buys laptop → Recommended product: Laptop bag (frequently bought together)

### Product Relationships

**Complementary products**: Items that enhance or complete the original purchase.

**Example**: Customer buys camera → Recommended product: Memory card or camera case

### Similar Products

**Alternative or upgraded versions**: Products in the same category or with similar attributes.

**Example**: Customer buys basic phone case → Recommended product: Premium phone case with extra features

### Customer Behavior

**Browsing history**: Products the customer viewed before purchasing.

**Example**: Customer bought Product A but viewed Product B → Recommended product: Product B

### Store-Wide Trends

**Popular products**: Best-selling items in your store.

**Example**: Customer buys any product → Recommended product: Current best-seller

## When to Use Auto Recommendations

Auto recommendations work best in these scenarios:

### Large Product Catalogs

**Best for**: Stores with 100+ products

**Why**: More products = more data = better recommendations

**Example**: Fashion retailer with hundreds of clothing items and accessories

### Broad Funnels

**Best for**: "Any product" or collection-wide triggers

**Why**: Dynamic recommendations adapt to each purchase

**Example**:
```
Trigger: Any product from "Electronics" collection
Offer: Auto recommendation (adapts based on specific product purchased)
```

### New Product Launches

**Best for**: Products without established upsell patterns yet

**Why**: Shopify can suggest related items from existing catalog

**Example**: New product added → Auto recommendations find complementary products automatically

### Testing & Learning

**Best for**: Finding which products work well together

**Why**: Let data reveal unexpected product pairings

**Example**: Run auto recommendations for one month, then review analytics to see which products were most frequently shown and accepted

## When NOT to Use Auto Recommendations

Manual product selection works better when:

### Strategic Promotions

**Use manual when**: Promoting specific products or clearing inventory

**Example**: Black Friday sale on specific items

### High-Value Upsells

**Use manual when**: You have a proven high-converting upsell

**Example**: Customer buys entry-level product → Always upsell premium version

### Brand Partnerships

**Use manual when**: Contractual obligations to promote specific brands

**Example**: Partnership requires featuring partner products

### Small Product Catalogs

**Use manual when**: Store has < 50 products

**Why**: Limited selection makes manual curation more effective

## Customizing Auto Recommendation Offers

Even with auto recommendations, you control:

### Discount Strategy

Apply discounts to auto-recommended products:

- **Fixed Amount**: $5 off, $10 off, etc.
- **Percentage**: 10%, 15%, 20% off
- **No Discount**: Full price

**Recommendation**: Start with 10-15% discount to boost conversions

### Visual Design

Customize how the offer appears:

- Product image display (single, gallery, zoom)
- Button text and colors
- Layout and spacing
- Font styles
- Background colors

### Messaging

Add custom text and copy:

- Offer title (e.g., "Complete Your Order")
- Product description override
- Urgency messaging
- Social proof elements

## Combining Manual and Auto Recommendations

Use both strategies strategically:

### Sequential Approach

**Strategy**: Manual upsell first, auto recommendation as downsell

**Example**:
```
Upsell Offer #1: Specific premium product (manual)
Downsell Offer: Auto recommendation (if upsell declined)
```

**Benefits**: Strategic first offer, data-driven fallback

### Segmented Approach

**Strategy**: Manual for high-value customers, auto for others

**Example**:
```
Funnel A (Priority 1):
  - Trigger: Any product
  - Condition: Cart total ≥ $100
  - Offer: Specific premium product (manual)

Funnel B (Priority 2):
  - Trigger: Any product
  - Condition: Cart total < $100
  - Offer: Auto recommendation
```

**Benefits**: Personalized experience at different price points

### Product-Specific Approach

**Strategy**: Manual for key products, auto for everything else

**Example**:
```
Funnel A (Priority 1):
  - Trigger: Best-selling product
  - Offer: Proven upsell product (manual)

Funnel B (Priority 2):
  - Trigger: Any other product
  - Offer: Auto recommendation
```

**Benefits**: Control important product journeys, automate the rest

## Analyzing Auto Recommendation Performance

Track how well auto recommendations perform:

### Key Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Conversion Rate" icon="percentage">
    Compare auto vs manual offer acceptance rates
  </Card>
  <Card title="Revenue per Offer" icon="dollar-sign">
    Average revenue from auto-recommended products

### Optimization Based on Analytics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low Conversion Rate (< 10%)">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Recommended products not relevant
    - Store doesn't have enough data yet
    - Discount too small

    **Solutions**:
    - Switch to manual product selection for key triggers
    - Increase discount percentage
    - Give Shopify more time to gather data
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Same Products Always Recommended">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Limited product catalog
    - One product is significantly more popular
    - Strong purchase pattern established

    **Solutions**:
    - This is actually good! Convert to manual funnel featuring that product
    - Consider A/B testing other complementary products
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Irrelevant Recommendations">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Insufficient data for new products
    - Products lack proper categorization
    - Shopify's algorithm needs more purchase history

    **Solutions**:
    - Improve product metadata (tags, collections, descriptions)
    - Use manual recommendations for new products
    - Build product relationships through bundles
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Improving Recommendation Quality

Help Shopify's algorithm make better suggestions:

### 1. Optimize Product Data

**Action**: Ensure all products have complete information

- Detailed descriptions
- Accurate categorization
- Consistent tagging
- Product relationships defined

### 2. Use Collections Effectively

**Action**: Group related products in collections

- Shopify uses collections to understand product relationships
- Well-organized collections = better recommendations

### 3. Build Purchase History

**Action**: Let the system learn from real transactions

- The more orders, the better the recommendations
- Takes time to establish patterns

### 4. Create Product Bundles

**Action**: Use Shopify's bundle features

- Shows Shopify which products work together
- Influences recommendation algorithm
