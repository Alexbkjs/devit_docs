Display conditions allow you to control exactly which customers see your offers. Create personalized funnels that target specific segments for maximum relevance and conversion.

## How Display Conditions Work

Display conditions filter which customers see your funnel based on criteria you define:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer Purchases">
    Customer completes checkout
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger Check">
    ReSell checks if purchased product matches funnel trigger
  </Step>
  <Step title="Conditions Check">
    ReSell evaluates all display conditions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Show or Skip">
    If all conditions pass → show offer. If any fail → skip to next funnel
  </Step>
</Steps>

```

### OR Logic (Any Can Match)

Customer needs to meet ANY ONE condition.

Conditions:
  - Country is Canada OR
  - Country is United States OR
  - Customer tag includes "North America"

Offer: Free shipping on next order
```

### Mixed Logic

Combine AND/OR for complex targeting.

**Example**:
```
Trigger: Any product from "Clothing"
Conditions:
  - (Country is UK OR Country is Ireland) AND
  - Cart total ≥ $50 AND
  - (First-time customer OR Customer tag includes "Promo-Eligible")

Offer: Accessory bundle
```

## Condition Priority & Fallbacks

When multiple funnels could trigger:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Priority Order">
    Funnels are evaluated in priority order (1 = highest)
  </Step>
  <Step title="First Match Wins">
    First funnel where all conditions pass is shown
  </Step>
  <Step title="Skip to Next">
    If conditions fail, next funnel in priority is evaluated
  </Step>
  <Step title="No Match">
    If no funnel conditions pass, no offer is shown
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Best Practice**: Set your most specific, high-value funnels to priority 1, and broader funnels to lower priorities as fallbacks.

    Set up funnel with specific conditions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Test Orders">
    Place test orders matching AND not matching conditions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Display">

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Funnel not showing to anyone">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Conditions too restrictive
    - No customers meet criteria
    - Conflicting conditions (impossible to satisfy)

    **Solution**: Review conditions and broaden criteria. Check analytics to see if funnel is being evaluated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Funnel showing too often">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Conditions too broad
    - Missing important filters

    **Solution**: Add more specific conditions to narrow targeting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Location conditions not working">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Shopify can't detect customer location
    - VPN or proxy hiding location
    - Testing from different country

    **Solution**: Use customer's billing or shipping country, which is always available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Customer tag conditions not matching">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Tags are case-sensitive
    - Typo in tag name
    - Customer doesn't have tag yet

    **Solution**: Verify exact tag spelling in Shopify admin. Tags must match exactly.
