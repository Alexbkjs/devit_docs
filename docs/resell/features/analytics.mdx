## Key Metrics Explained

### Impressions

The number of times your offers were displayed to customers.

**What it tells you**:
- How many eligible customers are seeing offers
- Whether your trigger conditions are too restrictive
- Traffic volume through your funnels

**Optimization tips**:
- Low impressions? Broaden display conditions
- High impressions but low conversions? Improve offer relevance

### Conversion Rate

Percentage of customers who accepted at least one offer.

**Calculation**: (Accepted Offers ÷ Total Impressions) × 100

**Industry benchmarks**:
- **Good**: 15-20% conversion rate
- **Great**: 20-30% conversion rate
- **Excellent**: 30%+ conversion rate

**Factors affecting conversion**:
- Offer relevance to original purchase
- Discount percentage
- Product positioning
- Offer placement timing
- Design and messaging

### Revenue Generated

Total additional revenue from accepted upsells and cross-sells.

**What it includes**:
- All accepted post-purchase offers
- Checkout upsells (Shopify Plus)
- Order status page purchases

**What it excludes**:
- Original order value
- Thank you page clicks (tracked separately)

### Average Order Value (AOV) Impact

How much ReSell increases your average order value.

**Calculation**: Average order value with accepted offers vs without

**Example**:
- Original AOV: $50
- AOV with ReSell: $65
- **Impact**: +30% ($15 increase per order)

**Problem**: Many customers see offers but few accept

**Solutions**:
- Increase discount percentage

- Improve offer design and copy
- Test different product types (upsell vs cross-sell)

### Low Impressions

**Problem**: Offers aren't showing to many customers

**Solutions**:
- Broaden trigger conditions (more products or collections)
- Check payment method compatibility
- Verify funnel is published and active
- Review display conditions (location, cart value, etc.)

### Good Overall Performance, Specific Offers Underperforming

**Problem**: Some offers in funnel convert well, others don't

**Solutions**:
- Replace low-performing products
- Adjust discount on weak offers
- Change offer sequence (move best performers first)
- Update product images or descriptions

### Declining Performance Over Time

**Problem**: Conversion rates dropping gradually

**Solutions**:
- Refresh product offerings seasonally
- Test new discount levels
- Update offer designs
- Rotate products to prevent offer fatigue
