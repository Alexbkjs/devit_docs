Display Conditions give you complete control over when and where your labels appear. Target specific products, customer segments, and scenarios to ensure labels are always relevant and effective.

## About Display Conditions

With Display Conditions, you can automatically apply labels without manual assignment. Set the right conditions, and labels will appear on matching products automatically.

<Note>
This feature eliminates the need to manually tag or update individual products. Changes to your catalog automatically trigger label visibility based on your rules.

## Combining Multiple Conditions

You can add multiple conditions to create precise targeting rules.

### AND Logic

When you add multiple conditions, **ALL** conditions must be met for the label to appear.

**Example**: Show label on products that:
- Have tag `premium` **AND**
- Are in "Featured Collection" **AND**
- Price is greater than $50

This ensures only premium, featured products above $50 show the label.

## Tips for Effective Conditions

1. **Keep It Dynamic**: Use conditions that automatically update (like product created date or inventory) instead of manual product selection
2. **Layer Conditions**: Combine multiple conditions for precise targeting without manual updates
3. **Use Exclusions**: Sometimes it's easier to exclude products than include them
4. **Plan for Scale**: Structure conditions to work as your catalog grows
5. **Test Edge Cases**: Verify labels appear correctly when products match or don't match conditions
