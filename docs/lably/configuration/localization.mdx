Lably makes it easy to localize your labels and badges for different languages and markets. When labels appear in a customer's native language, it improves user experience and builds trust.

## How to Add Translations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Label">
    Navigate to the label you want to translate and click to edit it
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Label Settings">
    In the left-side menu, click **Label** (or **Badge**)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Locales">
    Click the **Locales** button next to the text field
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Language">
    Choose your target language from the dropdown menu
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Translation">
    Type the translated text in the language-specific field
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Click **Apply** to save the translation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repeat for More Languages">
    Add as many language translations as needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Label">
    Click **Save** in the top-right corner to publish changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Localization Works

Lably automatically displays the appropriate translation based on:

- **Customer's browser language** settings
- **Shopify store locale** configuration
- **URL locale** parameter (e.g., `/en/`, `/fr/`, `/de/`)

If no translation exists for a customer's language, the default text is shown.

<Note>
Default text is the content you enter in the main text field before adding translations. Always set a good default for your primary market.
</Note>

## Supported Languages

Lably supports all languages that Shopify Markets and Translate & Adapt support, including:

- **European**: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, etc.
- **Asian**: Japanese, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional), Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, etc.
- **Middle Eastern**: Arabic, Hebrew, etc.
- **And many more**

## Translation Best Practices

### Keep It Concise

Short labels translate better and fit designs more easily.

**Good**: "Sale" → "Vente" (French)
**Avoid**: "Amazing Limited Time Sale Event" (too long, harder to translate)

### Consider Text Length

Different languages require different character counts for the same meaning:

- German words tend to be longer than English
- Chinese/Japanese can express ideas in fewer characters
- Arabic and Hebrew read right-to-left

<Tip>
Preview your labels in all languages to ensure text fits properly in your design. Adjust font size or label width if needed.
</Tip>

### Use Professional Translation

For best results:

- Use professional translation services for marketing copy
- Avoid machine translation for customer-facing content
- Have native speakers review translations
- Consider cultural context, not just literal translation

## Advanced: Dynamic Content

For labels with dynamic content (like stock quantities), the structure can remain the same across languages:

**English**: "Only {quantity} left!"
**French**: "Plus que {quantity} disponibles!"
**German**: "Nur noch {quantity} verfügbar!"
**Spanish**: "¡Solo quedan {quantity}!"

<Warning>
Dynamic variables syntax may vary. Contact support if you need help with dynamic content in multiple languages.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Translation not showing for a specific language">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Translation not saved properly (click Apply, then Save)
    - Shopify locale not configured for that language
    - Browser/customer locale doesn't match translation language

    **Solution**: Verify translation was saved, check Shopify Markets settings, test with browser language set to target locale.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Text doesn't fit in the label design">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Translated text is longer than original
    - Font doesn't support the language characters
    - Fixed label width is too narrow

    **Solution**: Adjust label width, reduce font size for that locale, or use a different font that supports the characters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Special characters not displaying correctly">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Font doesn't include necessary character sets
    - Encoding issues

    **Solution**: Choose a font with full Unicode support or a font specifically designed for that language (e.g., Noto Sans for Asian languages).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew) display incorrectly">
    **Possible causes**:
    - RTL text direction not automatically applied
    - Layout issues with RTL scripts

    **Solution**: Contact support@devit.software for assistance with RTL language configuration.
