Lably is a powerful Shopify app that helps you create and manage custom product labels and badges. Make your products stand out with eye-catching visuals, highlight promotions, and drive more sales with fully customizable labels.

## What is Lably?

Lably enables you to add professional labels and badges to your products with powerful customization options and intelligent display rules. Whether you want to highlight new arrivals, promote sales, or build trust with quality badges, Lably makes it easy.

**Labels vs Badges**: Labels appear on product images, while badges are displayed in product content areas. You can use both on the same product.
