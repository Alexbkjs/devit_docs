## General Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I add both label and badge to the same product?">
    Yes! You can add both labels and badges to the same product. Labels are displayed on the product image, while badges appear in the product content area. This combination can be very effective for highlighting multiple product attributes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I add multiple labels or badges?">
    Absolutely. You can create as many labels and badges as you need (up to 3 on the Free plan, unlimited on paid plans). Multiple labels can appear on the same product if they meet their respective display conditions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will Lably slow down my store?">
    No. Lably is optimized for performance and uses efficient loading techniques to ensure minimal impact on your store's speed. Labels are rendered using lightweight code that loads asynchronously.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is Lably compatible with my theme?">
    Yes! Lably works with all Shopify themes, including custom themes. The app uses smart detection to find product images and content areas. If you encounter any issues, you can use custom selectors for precise control.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Lably with page builders like PageFly?">
    Yes, Lably is compatible with popular page builders. You may need to use custom selectors to ensure labels appear correctly on page builder elements. Check our [custom selectors guide](/lably/configuration/custom-selectors) for details.
  </Accordion>

## Display Rules & Conditions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I display labels to customers based on their location?">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I display labels and badges for specific products only?">
    Absolutely. The **Display Conditions** feature lets you target specific products using:
    - **Product tags**: Show labels on products with specific tags

    - **Vendor**: Show labels for specific brands

    - Enable or disable specific days
    - Set different time ranges for each day
    - Create schedules for business hours only
    - Match promotional timing

    By default, all days are enabled for 24/7 display.
  </Accordion>

    Use the **Display Period** option:
    1. Click **Display period** in the left menu
    2. Disable the "All time" option

    This is perfect for seasonal promotions, flash sales, or limited-time offers. Labels will automatically appear and disappear based on your schedule.
  </Accordion>

    Yes! Use the **Compare at price** condition:
    1. Go to **Display Conditions**
    2. Click **Add condition**
    3. Select **Compare at price**
    4. Configure to show when compare-at price exists

    This ensures labels only appear on products that are on sale.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I apply custom CSS selectors?">
    Yes! Custom selectors give you precise control over where labels appear. This is useful for:
    - Custom themes
    - Page builders
    - Non-standard product layouts
    - Special positioning requirements

    See our [Custom Selectors guide](/lably/configuration/custom-selectors) for implementation details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do labels work on mobile devices?">
    Yes! All labels are fully responsive and automatically adapt to mobile devices. You can also customize label sizes and positions specifically for mobile views if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will labels appear in my product images on social media?">
    No. Lably labels are displayed dynamically on your website only. They don't modify your actual product images, so they won't appear when products are shared on social media or in Shopify's product feed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export or backup my labels?">
    Currently, labels are stored securely in the Lably app. If you need to migrate labels or create backups, contact our support team at support@devit.software.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My labels are not showing - what should I do?">
    If labels aren't appearing, check the following:

    1. **Label is saved and enabled**: Ensure you clicked Save
    2. **Display conditions**: Verify conditions match your products
    3. **Display period**: Check that current date falls within the period
    4. **Week schedule**: Ensure current day/time is enabled
    5. **Page visibility**: Confirm label is enabled for the current page
    6. **Theme compatibility**: Try using custom selectors if needed

    See our [Troubleshooting guide](/lably/support/troubleshooting) for detailed solutions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Labels are showing in the wrong position">
    If labels appear in unexpected locations:
    - Use the **Position** controls to adjust placement
    - Try different position presets (top-left, top-right, etc.)
    - Adjust margins for fine-tuning
    - Consider using custom selectors for precise control

    Different themes may have different image container structures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Labels look different than the preview">
    Preview shows how labels will appear on your storefront, but some factors can affect final display:
    - Browser caching (clear cache and reload)
    - Theme CSS overrides (use custom CSS if needed)
    - Mobile vs desktop view (different responsive breakpoints)

    If issues persist, contact support with screenshots.
  </Accordion>
