If your labels aren't showing up or displaying correctly, this guide will help you identify and fix the issue.

## Labels Not Showing

If labels aren't appearing on your storefront, work through these checks in order:

### 1. Check App Embed Status

The most common reason labels don't appear is the app embed being disabled.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Theme Customizer">
    Shopify Admin → Online Store → Themes → Customize
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Theme Settings">
    Click the theme settings icon (usually in left sidebar)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find App Embeds">
    Scroll down to the **App embeds** section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Lably">
    Find **Lably** in the list and toggle it ON (should be blue/green)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** in the top right corner
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    View your storefront to check if labels now appear
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If you recently updated or changed your theme, app embeds may be disabled by default. Always check this first.
</Warning>

### 2. Verify Label Status

Ensure your label is published and active.

**Check for**:
- Label status is **Published** (not Draft or Unpublished)
- Label is not paused or archived
- Label appears in your active labels list

**How to fix**:
1. Go to Lably dashboard
2. Find the label in your list
3. Check status column
4. Click label → Change status to Published
5. Save changes

### 3. Review Display Settings

Labels may be hidden due to scheduling or page visibility settings.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Week Schedule" icon="calendar">
    **Check**: Is today/now within the scheduled time?

    **How to check**:
    1. Open label → Left menu → **Week schedule**
    2. Verify current day is enabled
    3. Check that current time falls within enabled hours
    4. Default is 24/7 - if you see restrictions, this may be the issue

    **Quick fix**: Enable all days and hours to test
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Display Period" icon="clock">
    **Check**: Is today's date within the display period?

    **How to check**:
    1. Open label → Left menu → **Display period**
    2. If "All time" is disabled, check dates
    3. Ensure current date is between start and end dates

    **Quick fix**: Enable "All time" to test
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Visibility on Pages" icon="eye">
    **Check**: Is the label enabled for the page you're viewing?

    **How to check**:
    1. Open label → Left menu → **Visibility on pages**
    2. Verify checkboxes for relevant pages:
       - Home page
       - Collection pages
       - Product pages
       - Search results

    **Quick fix**: Enable all pages to test
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 4. Check Display Conditions

Labels with display conditions only appear when conditions are met.

**Common issues**:
- Product doesn't match the condition criteria
- Condition is too restrictive
- Multiple conditions are conflicting

**How to check**:
1. Open label → Left menu → **Display conditions**
2. Review all active conditions
3. Verify your test product meets ALL conditions

**Quick fix**: Temporarily remove all conditions to test if label appears

**Example issue**:
```
Condition: Product tag = "sale"
Problem: Test product doesn't have "sale" tag
Solution: Add tag to product OR remove condition to test
```

### 5. Verify Custom Selectors

If you've added custom selectors, they may be incorrect.

**How to check**:
1. Open label → Left menu → **Position**
2. Find **Custom CSS selector** field
3. Check if selector is populated

**Quick fix**:
1. Clear the custom selector field
2. Save and test
3. If labels now appear, the selector was wrong
4. See [Custom Selectors guide](/lably/configuration/custom-selectors) for proper setup

### 6. Clear Cache

Browser and CDN caching can prevent labels from appearing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clear Browser Cache">
    Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clear Shopify Cache">
    Edit any theme file (add a space), save, then undo and save again
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait">
    Give it 2-3 minutes for CDN to update
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test in Incognito">
    Open store in private/incognito window
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Labels in Wrong Position

If labels appear but in the wrong location:

### Adjust Position Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Label">
    Navigate to the problematic label
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Position">
    Left menu → **Position**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try Presets">
    Click position presets: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Margins">
    Fine-tune with margin sliders (top, right, bottom, left)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and Test">
    Save changes and view storefront
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Use Custom Selectors

If position adjustments don't work, your theme may need custom selectors.

## Labels Look Different Than Preview

### Check for Theme CSS Conflicts

**Possible causes**:
- Theme CSS overriding label styles
- Custom CSS in theme conflicting with labels
- Third-party app CSS interference

**Solutions**:
1. Disable other apps temporarily to test
2. Check theme's custom CSS for conflicts
3. Contact support with screenshots of both preview and live

### Browser Compatibility

Test in multiple browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

If labels work in one browser but not another, it may be a CSS compatibility issue.

## Labels Not Showing on Mobile

### Check Responsive Settings

Some themes have different structures for mobile vs desktop.

**How to test**:
1. Open storefront on mobile device or use browser DevTools
2. Toggle device toolbar (F12 → device icon)
3. Check if labels appear

**Possible fixes**:
- Adjust label size for mobile in Styles settings
- Create separate labels for mobile (use custom selectors)
- Disable animations on mobile if causing issues

## Performance Issues

### Labels Slow Down Page Load

Labels should have minimal performance impact, but if you notice slowdown:

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce number of active labels (combine similar labels)
2. Optimize label images (compress PNG/JPG files)
3. Disable complex animations
4. Use text labels instead of image labels when possible

### Labels Flicker or Flash on Load

**Causes**:
- Labels loading after page renders
- CSS not inlined properly

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure app embed is enabled
2. Contact support if flickering persists

## Labels Disappear After Theme Update

**Why this happens**:
- Theme updates may change HTML structure
- App embeds get disabled during theme switch
- Custom selectors may no longer match

**How to fix**:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Re-enable App Embed">
    Theme may have disabled Lably embed during update
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Labels">
    View storefront to see if labels now appear
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Custom Selectors">
    If using custom selectors, they may need updating for new theme structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Contact Support">
    If labels still don't work, theme structure may have changed significantly
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Specific Theme Issues

### Page Builder Apps (PageFly, Shogun, GemPages)

Page builders often require custom selectors.

### Highly Custom Themes

If you have a heavily customized or custom-built theme:

3. Contact support for assistance
